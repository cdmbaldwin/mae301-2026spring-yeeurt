# MVP Implementation - Team YEEURT

## Overview
This directory contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our AI startup idea, which leverages our nanoGPT model (or another suitable AI model) to address a specific user problem.

## Contents
*   `src/`: Source code for the MVP application.
*   `data/`: Data used by the MVP, or instructions for downloading it.
*   `models/`: Checkpoints or instructions for accessing the trained AI model.
*   `README.md`: This file, with setup and demo instructions.
*   `report.md`: The comprehensive MVP report.

## Demo Instructions

This section provides instructions on how to set up the environment and run a minimal demo of the MVP.

1.  **Set up Environment:**
    [Detailed steps to install dependencies, create virtual environments, etc. Link to `requirements.txt` if applicable.]

2.  **Run Minimal Demo:**
    [Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to start the MVP. For example:]
    ```bash
    # Example for a Python-based web UI (e.g., Streamlit)
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
    source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    streamlit run src/app.py
    ```
    [Then, instruct the user to open a browser:]
    "Open `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser."

3.  **API Keys (if applicable):**
    [If your MVP uses external APIs, describe where users should place their API keys (e.g., environment variables, a `config.ini` file).]

## Optional: Demo Video
[Link to a 3-5 minute demo video if available.]
